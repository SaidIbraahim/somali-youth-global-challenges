# Breaking Barriers: Addressing Systemic Challenges Faced by Somali Youth on the Global Stage

## Introduction

For decades, Somali youth have demonstrated remarkable resilience, ambition, and ingenuity despite the systemic barriers they face in accessing global opportunities. Whether it is pursuing international education, earning through freelance platforms, or leveraging digital tools, many doors remain closed to Somalis—not because of their lack of talent, but because of deeply rooted geopolitical, financial, and infrastructural challenges.

However, these barriers are not insurmountable. With strategic action from the Somali government, private sector, and society as a whole, these challenges can be mitigated, unlocking new possibilities for Somalia’s youth to thrive on a global scale.

This article identifies these challenges and proposes actionable, practical solutions to pave the way forward.

## Understanding the Challenges

Here are some of the key systemic barriers Somali youth currently face:

1. **Business and Digital Platforms**  
   Services like Amazon Affiliates, YouTube Partner Program, and major freelance platforms (e.g., Upwork, Fiverr) exclude Somalia due to financial restrictions, regulatory concerns, and limited infrastructure.

2. **International Education**  
   Somali students are often excluded from scholarship programs and struggle to access testing centers like IELTS or secure visas for study abroad.

3. **Financial Services**  
   Somalia remains disconnected from global financial tools like PayPal, Stripe, and cryptocurrency exchanges due to international sanctions and weak banking systems.

4. **Travel Restrictions**  
   Obtaining visas is particularly difficult for Somalis due to limited diplomatic representation and ongoing security perceptions.

These barriers not only isolate Somalia but also deprive the world of the immense potential its youth hold.
